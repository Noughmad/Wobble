#  This module defines the following variables:
#     YAML_FOUND       - True if YAML_INCLUDE_DIR & YAML_LIBRARY are found
#     YAML_LIBRARIES   - Set when YAML_LIBRARY is found
#     YAML_INCLUDE_DIRS - Set when YAML_INCLUDE_DIR is found
#
#     YAML_INCLUDE_DIR - where to find asoundlib.h, etc.
#     YAML_LIBRARY     - the asound library
